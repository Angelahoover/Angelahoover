### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a startup founder working on Andi - Search for the Next Generation.

Andi is an AI search assistant that delivers direct answers and uses AI to find high-quality information without spam, ads or tracking.

I love building things. I'm excited about AI-powered coding tools, and learning Python and data analytics. I'm interested in all things privacy and AI.
